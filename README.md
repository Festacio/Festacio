Hi, I’m Fernando Estácio. I'm a Computing Science student of UERJ (Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro). I was born in Brazil. 
I'm really passionate about computers, specially games, hardware parts (not in an in-depth kind of way) and programming.

- I’m interested in Back-end programming.
- I’m currently learning C++ by submitting some Beecrowd programs and C# for Unity engine.

- I’m currently looking for an internship on any back-end related area, so I can get some professional experience and a taste of
  some real world situations, using APIs, making more robust codes for security reasons, learning more good manners 
  and patterns for coding, etc.

If I had to describe what I currently know, using 1 to 10, with 1 - 6 being the basics and 7 - 10 being more specific knowledge about the subject.

- English level: 7. 
(My speech is really rusty.)

- Logical reasoning: 6.
(My logical thinking is pretty solid in my opinion, but I would'nt go as far as to say that it's flawless or something like that. I have yet much to learn and see.)

- C: 4.
- C++: 5.
- C#: 5.
(I like C and its family.)

- Python: 4.
(I think Python is a very good language, it's accessible, it's massive popular nowadays and it even is a great starting point for the basics 
of programing and logic thinking. I just didn't get to use it much outside of my classes.)

- Java: 3.
(I would be open to learn it properly if any opportunity appears.)
